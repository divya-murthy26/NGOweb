                FCI launched its training wing <span class="bold">“FCI Training Centre”</span> in Bangalore
                in the year 2016. Training in Skill Enhancement was conducted for
                several batches of girl students pursuing engineering courses. The
                training was offered in soft skills, technical skills, and
                professional skills, mainly focusing on preparing them for jobs.

                <span class="bold">IVT-India</span> was the training partner
                of Find a Child in India to conduct these training sessions. The
                training centre was closed in 2020 when COVID-19 crept in as the
                sessions were moved online.
