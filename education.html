                    The "Drawing Competition" is a platform for children to exhibit
                    their artistic talents, express their dreams, and gain competition
                    experience. It is open to underprivileged school-going children from
                    grades 1 to 9, regardless of their region, religion, or caste.

                <p class="description">
                    This event helps children build self-confidence, shifting their
                    mindset from "I can't draw" to "I can enter this contest... and I
                    might win!"
