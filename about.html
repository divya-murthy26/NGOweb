        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>At <strong>Fund a Child in India (FCI)</strong>, we believe in empowering young women with the skills and
            confidence needed to thrive in the tech industry. FCI is a dedicated NGO that focuses on building a strong
            foundation for girls in technology.</p>

        <p>Our primary mission is to equip <strong>UVCE girls</strong> with essential industry-ready skills, helping
            them bridge the gap between education and employment. Through technical training, soft skills development,
            and aptitude coaching, we prepare them for a bright future in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

        <p>FCI is more than just a training initiative—it’s a movement to <strong>empower, uplift, and inspire</strong>
            young women to break barriers and excel in their careers. By providing comprehensive training in both
            technical and interpersonal skills, we ensure that every girl gets the opportunity she deserves.</p>

        <p>Join us in shaping a future where every girl in tech has the skills, confidence, and support to succeed!</p>
